### TOOLS

Tools used to build application. Ideally you should use same versions or higher to sure it works properly.

* PHP version: 5.3.13
* MySQL version: 5.5.24
* Apache: 2.2.22

### INSTRUCTIONS

* You should create a database called: **rtproject** and a db user called **rtuser** with password **rtu53r**
* And then should run db/model.sql script to populate the new db.
* One user with high privilegies was created (login: *admin@example.com* / password: *123123*), you should change both as soon as possible.
* Index file is missing, this is deliberate, but you can request it from me anytime
